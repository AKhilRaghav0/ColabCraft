This project is designed to allow you to host a Minecraft server on Google Colab using Google Compute Engine, and save your world files to Google Drive for easy backup and sharing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to create a new Google Colab notebook and follow the instructions provided in the `ColabCraft.ipynb` file.

## Usage

Once you have followed the instructions in the `ColabCraft.ipynb` file, you can start your Minecraft server by running the last cell in the notebook. Your server address will be provided by Ngrok.

## Saving Your World Files

Your world files will be saved to your Google Drive account in a folder called `Minecraft-server`. You can access these files at any time by logging into your Google Drive account and navigating to the `Minecraft-server` folder.
